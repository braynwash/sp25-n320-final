# N320 Final

## Snake Milkers Site

### Project Summary

The odd job we chose for our final project is [snake milking](https://www.environmentalscience.org/career/snake-milker), also called the "Deadliest Job in America." Aside from its strange name, snake milking actually provides an essential service- by "milking" a snake of it's venom, the venom can either be given to biologists who conduct further research into it's properties and find new applications for its use (ie. new antibiotics) or new genetic discoveries, OR given to medical professionals who turn the venom into antitodes FOR said venom. It's an extremely fascinating job with quite a few different roles it plays. In our project, we hope to shed some light on this profession

### Key Takeaways

<!-- Understanding of why we are doing this project -->

Our project aims to educate and inform viewers about the value and process of snake milking through engaging and visual content.

Snake milking is a niche, high-risk profession with significant scientific and medical impact.

The profession supports both venom research and antivenom production.

The project highlights the visual intrigue and biological complexity of snake milking.

Emphasis was placed on strong visual communication to reduce reliance on text-heavy explanations.

### Design Choices

**Color Palette**

- White
- Shade(s) of green
- One soft shade of dark brown

In this color palette, I imagine the white would be a majority of the BG color while the interactable (buttons, cursor hovers) OR colored elements (nav BG, heading color) can be some shade(s) of green and brown to match colors commonly associated with snakes. White is a very "clinical" color as well, and the job does involve careful research; I feel the white would give the website a touch of professionalism.

For the layout, I'd like the website to have lots of images and display them front and center. The act of milking a snake is strangely fascinating to watch, and having embedded videos OR images showing the act alongside some herptapology/biology visuals showing what happens to a snake during a milking can easily and quickly inform viewers of how the job works without lengthy explanation.
