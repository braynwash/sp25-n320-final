      <h2>Snake Milking: A Brief History</h2>
      <div class="historyChunk">
        <section>
          <p>
            Snake milking is the process of extracting venom from snakes, and it has a long and
            fascinating history. The practice dates back to ancient times when people recognized the
            medicinal properties of snake venom. However, it wasn't until the late 19th century that
            snake milking became a formalized practice for medical purposes.

          <p>
            The first recorded instance of snake milking for medical purposes occurred in 1895 when
            a French scientist named Albert Calmette developed the first antivenom using venom from
            the Indian cobra. This breakthrough led to the establishment of snake farms and
            laboratories dedicated to venom extraction and research.

        <p>
          Another one of the most famous early snake milkers was Ross Allen, who made a name for
          himself in the 1920s by performing public demonstrations at his Reptile Institute in
          Florida. Allen helped show the world that with the right training, technique, and a lot of
          guts, people could safely harvest venom for important scientific work. Over time, snake
          milking grew into a real profession, supplying venom to labs, universities, and
          pharmaceutical companies. Today, milking snakes is still critical, not just for making
          antivenoms, but also for developing new medicines. Even now, a lot of the methods haven't
          changed much: itâ€™s still one person, one snake, and a whole lot of respect (and caution)
          between them.
